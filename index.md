# brapiR2

**brapiR2** is a tidyverse-native, stateless R client for the [BrAPI
v2](https://brapi.org/) (Breeding API) specification. It provides
pipe-friendly, read-only access across all four BrAPI modules - Core,
Germplasm, Phenotyping, and Genotyping - wrapping 32 of the
specification’s 37 entities (49 of 138 retrieval endpoints) and
returning tidy tibbles ready for analysis.

Developed by **Joash Joshua Ayo** (<joashjoshua789@gmail.com>).

## Supported BrAPI Modules

Every entity brapiR2 wraps, by module:

- **Core**: Programs, Trials, Studies, Locations, Seasons, Lists, People
- **Germplasm**: Germplasm, Progeny, Attributes, Crosses, Seed Lots, and
  Pedigree - both single-germplasm
  ([`brapi_germplasm_pedigree()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_germplasm_pedigree.md))
  and batch/tree retrieval across many germplasm at once
  ([`brapi_pedigree()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_pedigree.md),
  [`brapi_search_pedigree()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_search_pedigree.md))
- **Phenotyping**: Observation Units, Observations, Variables, Traits,
  Scales, Methods, Ontologies, Images, Events
- **Genotyping**: Samples, Variants, Variant Sets, Calls, Call Sets,
  References, Allele Matrix, Genome Maps

Not yet covered: Common Crop Names, Germplasm Attribute Values, Planned
Crosses, Plates, and Vendor Samples (lab/vendor order-tracking). brapiR2
is read-only by design - it does not implement BrAPI’s `POST`/`PUT`
write endpoints.

For the full list of endpoints and the function that wraps each one, see
[`?brapi_coverage`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_coverage.md).
Each function’s own help page names its endpoint, links to the BrAPI
v2.1 specification, and lists the query parameters that endpoint
accepts.

## Tested against

brapiR2 is developed against the public BrAPI test server and exercised
against every publicly reachable BrAPI v2 server I could find. As of
September 2026 that is eight servers across three implementations: the
reference server, six Breedbase deployments (Cassavabase,
Sweetpotatobase, Coffeabase, Citrusgreening, and the T3 oat and wheat
sandboxes), and USDA-GRIN, which runs GRIN-Global. Of 80 endpoint
probes, 62 succeeded. The failures are server-side rather than
client-side - timeouts on the largest Breedbase instances, `HTTP 500` on
two of them, and endpoints GRIN-Global does not implement - and each one
is recorded in
[dev/SERVERS.md](https://github.com/ropensci/brapiR2/blob/main/dev/SERVERS.md),
alongside the script that produced them.

BMS, EBS, GIGWA and Germinate have not been tested; I have no access to
an instance of any of them. If you use brapiR2 against one of those, or
any other BrAPI v2 server, reports of what does and does not work are
welcome in the issue tracker.

## Installation

Install from rOpenSci’s R-universe:

``` r

install.packages(
  "brapiR2",
  repos = c("https://ropensci.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org")
)
```

Or the development version from GitHub:

``` r

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ropensci/brapiR2")
```

`pak` builds the vignette as part of the install. If you prefer
`remotes` or `devtools`, pass `build_vignettes = TRUE`, or the vignette
will not be installed:

``` r

remotes::install_github("ropensci/brapiR2", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Quick Start

``` r

library(brapiR2)
library(dplyr)

# 1. Connect (no global state!)
con <- brapi_connection("https://test-server.brapi.org")

# 2. Explore programs and trials
brapi_programs(con)

brapi_trials(con) |>
  filter(active == TRUE) |>
  head()

# 3. Get phenotypic data in analysis-ready wide format
data <- brapi_study_data(con, "study_01")

# 4. Get genotypic data as a dosage matrix for GS
dosage <- brapi_get_dosage_matrix(con, "variantset_01")

# 5. Parallel fetch across multiple studies - set the backend yourself;
#    brapi_fetch_parallel() uses whatever plan is active rather than
#    setting one for you
future::plan(future::multisession, workers = 4)
all_data <- brapi_fetch_parallel(
  con,
  brapi_study_data,
  ids = c("study_01", "study_02", "study_03")
)
future::plan(future::sequential) # shut the workers back down when done
```

## Authentication

``` r

# Token-based (most BrAPI servers)
con <- brapi_connection("https://my-breedbase.org")
con <- brapi_login(con, "username", "password")

# OAuth 2.0 (EBS and similar)
con <- brapi_login_oauth2(
  con,
  client_id = "my_id",
  client_secret = "my_secret",
  authorize_url = "https://auth.example.org/authorize",
  access_url = "https://auth.example.org/token"
)

# Or set an existing token directly
con <- brapi_set_token(con, "my_existing_token")
```

## Pipe-Friendly Design

Every function takes a connection object as its first argument and
returns a tibble, making it natural to chain with dplyr:

``` r

con <- brapi_connection("https://my-breedbase.org", token = "my_token")

# Find all germplasm used in a specific study
brapi_observation_units(con, studyDbId = "study_42") |>
  select(germplasmDbId, germplasmName) |>
  distinct()

# Get marker positions for a genotyping dataset - from the Genome Maps
# entity (a marker's position on a named map), not from Variant's own
# assembly coordinates, which many servers leave unpopulated
brapi_get_marker_map(con, variantSetDbId = "my_variantset") |>
  filter(linkageGroupName == "chr1") |>
  arrange(position)
```

**brapiR2 complements
[QBMS](https://cran.r-project.org/package=QBMS)** - use QBMS for
interactive exploration, use brapiR2 for programmatic pipelines and
custom tooling.

### Other BrAPI v2 clients

[brapir-v2](https://github.com/mverouden/brapir-v2) is another R client
that, like brapiR2, targets the BrAPI v2 specification directly rather
than v1. Its own README describes it as still under development, and the
repository has had no commits in roughly four years (last pushed April
2022) - it does not appear to be actively maintained.

[BrAPI.R](https://github.com/TriticeaeToolbox/BrAPI.R) (David Waring,
Cornell) is a different kind of tool entirely, and complementary rather
than competing: its own DESCRIPTION calls it “simple wrapper functions
for httr that make it easier to make manual HTTP calls to a BrAPI
server”, and its README is explicit that it “does not have any knowledge
of the currently supported BrAPI endpoints”. It’s a transport layer -
callers pass endpoint paths as strings (`GET`, `POST`, and `PUT` are all
supported, plus a two-step search helper) and get back raw nested lists,
with a version argument that switches between BrAPI v1 and v2. It also
ships Breedbase-specific functions explicitly outside the BrAPI spec.
brapiR2 takes the opposite approach - named per-endpoint functions
returning tibbles - and covers less ground on writes: BrAPI.R’s
`POST`/`PUT` support covers exactly the write operations brapiR2
deliberately omits.
