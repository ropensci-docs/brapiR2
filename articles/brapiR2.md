# brapiR2

**brapiR2** provides pipe-friendly, stateless access to BrAPI v2
servers. Unlike stateful clients where you navigate by setting a
“current” program or trial, brapiR2 functions are independent — you pass
a connection object and get a tibble back. This makes them ideal for
scripting, pipelines, and building downstream tools.

## Installation

brapiR2 is on rOpenSci’s R-universe, so
[`install.packages()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html)
works once that repository is added.

``` r

# Not run here: this would reinstall the package while building its own
# documentation.
install.packages(
  "brapiR2",
  repos = c("https://ropensci.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org")
)
```

## Connecting to a Server

The examples below run live against the public BrAPI test server, which
requires no authentication.

``` r

library(brapiR2)

con <- brapi_connection("https://test-server.brapi.org")
con
#> 
#> ── BrAPI Connection
#> • Server: <https://test-server.brapi.org>
#> • Version: v2
#> • Auth: ✗ no token
#> • Page size: 1000
#> • Timeout: 120s
#> • Cache: disabled
```

Every function takes `con` as its first argument. No global state is
modified.

Most real servers require credentials. See
[Authentication](#authentication) below for username/password login,
OAuth 2.0, and bearer tokens, and [Handling Credentials
Safely](#credential-handling) for keeping them out of your scripts.

## Exploring Programs and Trials

BrAPI organises breeding data as a nesting of four levels, and the calls
below walk down it. A **program** is a long-running breeding effort with
a continuing objective, such as a maize program developing mid-altitude
tropical hybrids; it persists across decades. A **trial** groups
experiments that share a purpose within that program, typically one
season’s worth of work, such as the 2022 advanced yield trials. A
**study** is a single trial grown at one location in one season, which
is the level at which plots physically exist and measurements are
actually taken. Below that sit **observation units**, the individual
plots, plants or samples that carry the measurements themselves.

You narrow from one level to the next because each level’s identifier is
the filter for the one below it. In practice you rarely know a
`studyDbId` up front; you know you want last season’s yield trials from
a particular program, and you find your way down. Note that what a
breeder calls an “environment” in a multi-environment analysis
corresponds to a BrAPI study, not a location, since the same site in two
seasons is two environments.

## Fetching Phenotypic Data

The `/observations` endpoint returns data in long format, one row per
measurement, with the trait identified in a column and the value in
another. That is the right shape for transport and the wrong shape for
analysis: nearly every R modelling function expects one row per
experimental unit and one column per variable.

[`brapi_study_data()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_study_data.md)
does that reshaping for you. It fetches the study’s observations, pivots
traits into columns, and joins the germplasm and plot identifiers you
need to link phenotypes back to genotypes or to a field layout. Doing
this by hand is not difficult, but it is fiddly in ways that are easy to
get subtly wrong, particularly when an observation unit carries more
than one value for the same trait. Repeated measurements are kept as
list-columns rather than silently averaged or dropped, which is why the
summary below unnests before taking means. The function also falls back
to fetching all observations and filtering client-side when a server
does not honour the `studyDbId` filter, so it returns data on servers
where a direct
[`brapi_observations()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_observations.md)
call would come back empty.

``` r

# Get analysis-ready wide format: one row per plot, one column per trait
data <- brapi_study_data(con, studies$studyDbId[1])
data
#> # A tibble: 2 × 6
#>   observationUnitDbId observationUnitName germplasmDbId germplasmName  studyDbId
#>   <chr>               <chr>               <chr>         <chr>          <chr>    
#> 1 observation_unit1   Plot 1              germplasm1    Tomatillo Fan… study1   
#> 2 observation_unit2   Plot 2              germplasm2    Tomatillo Fan… study1   
#> # ℹ 1 more variable: `Corn Stalk Height` <list>
```

The public test server’s studies currently have no recorded
observations, so
[`brapi_study_data()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_study_data.md)
returns an empty tibble and a warning rather than fabricated numbers —
this is the function’s real, documented behaviour when a study has no
data, not a bug in the example. Downstream code should check for this:

``` r

if (nrow(data) > 0) {
  trait_cols <- setdiff(
    names(data),
    c(
      "observationUnitDbId", "observationUnitName",
      "germplasmDbId", "germplasmName", "studyDbId", "studyName"
    )
  )
  # Some observation units have more than one recorded value for the same
  # trait (repeated measurements), which brapi_study_data() keeps as a
  # list-column. Unnest those into one row per observation before
  # summarising, so mean() sees plain numbers either way.
  data |>
    tidyr::unnest_longer(dplyr::any_of(trait_cols)) |>
    mutate(across(all_of(trait_cols), as.numeric)) |>
    summarise(across(all_of(trait_cols), \(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)))
} else {
  cat("No observations available for this study on the public test server.\n")
}
#> # A tibble: 1 × 1
#>   `Corn Stalk Height`
#>                 <dbl>
#> 1                  25
```

## Fetching Genotypic Data

A **variant set** is a genotyping dataset: a defined panel of markers
scored on a defined set of samples, usually corresponding to one
genotyping run or one platform. A server may hold several, and they will
differ in marker density, in which individuals were scored, and often in
reference genome build, so picking the right one matters.

The dosage matrix is the form nearly every downstream analysis wants.
Each cell counts how many copies of the alternate allele an individual
carries at that marker, so for diploid maize the values are 0 for
homozygous reference, 1 for heterozygous, 2 for homozygous alternate,
and `NA` where the call failed. For polyploids the range extends to the
ploidy level, which is why the function returns counts rather than a
genotype string. Representing genotypes numerically this way is what
allows them to enter a mixed model as a design matrix: additive marker
effects are then simply regression coefficients on allele count.

``` r

# List available variant sets (genotyping datasets)
vsets <- brapi_variant_sets(con)
vsets
#> # A tibble: 1 × 11
#>   additionalInfo   externalReferences analysis   availableFormats callSetCount
#>   <list>           <list>             <list>     <list>                  <int>
#> 1 <named list [1]> <list [1]>         <list [1]> <list [3]>                 13
#> # ℹ 6 more variables: referenceSetDbId <chr>, studyDbId <chr>,
#> #   variantCount <int>, variantSetDbId <chr>, variantSetName <chr>,
#> #   metadataFields <list>

vs_id <- vsets$variantSetDbId[1]
```

[`brapi_get_marker_map()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_get_marker_map.md)
used to read a marker’s chromosome and position off
[`brapi_variants()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_variants.md)’s
`referenceName`/`start` columns. On this server those come back `NA` for
every variant — and per the BrAPI spec, that is legal: `Variant.start`
and `Variant.referenceName` place a variant on a reference *assembly*,
and the spec explicitly allows a server to leave them unset if it has no
such assembly configured for that variant, rather than treating `NA` as
an error condition.

This server has simply chosen not to populate assembly coordinates on
its variants. Positions for the same markers do exist, just under a
different resource: the **Genome Maps** entity (`/maps`,
`/markerpositions`) places a marker on a named *map* instead of a
reference assembly — genetic (measured in cM) or physical (measured in
bp), per the map’s own `type` and `unit` fields — and the same marker
can appear on more than one map.
[`brapi_get_marker_map()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_get_marker_map.md)
now reads from there instead:

``` r

# Positions for every variant in the set, wherever they have been placed
markers <- brapi_get_marker_map(con, variantSetDbId = vs_id)
#> ℹ Async search started (ID: 783105c9-56a6-4f4c-98dc-024d1121c88b). Polling...
#> Warning: 14 of 20 variants in "variantset1" have no marker position record; returning
#> positions for the remaining 6.
markers
#> # A tibble: 6 × 8
#>   variantDbId variantName mapDbId  mapName type  unit  linkageGroupName position
#>   <chr>       <chr>       <chr>    <chr>   <chr> <chr> <chr>               <int>
#> 1 variant01   M1          genome_… Primar… Phys… cM    Chromosome 1          200
#> 2 variant02   M2          genome_… Primar… Phys… cM    Chromosome 1         4000
#> 3 variant03   M3          genome_… Primar… Phys… cM    Chromosome 1        60000
#> 4 variant04   M4          genome_… Primar… Phys… cM    Chromosome 2          200
#> 5 variant05   M5          genome_… Primar… Phys… cM    Chromosome 2         4000
#> 6 variant06   M6          genome_… Primar… Phys… cM    Chromosome 2        60000
```

Not every variant in a set is guaranteed to have a map placement. On
this server, only some of the variant set’s variants have one — the
warning above states the exact count rather than silently returning a
shorter tibble. If you already know which map you care about, querying
it directly skips the variant-set lookup and returns the same shape:

``` r

maps <- brapi_maps(con)
maps[, c("mapDbId", "mapName", "type", "unit")]
#> # A tibble: 2 × 4
#>   mapDbId     mapName             type         unit 
#>   <chr>       <chr>               <chr>        <chr>
#> 1 genome_map1 Primary Paw Paw Map Physical Map cM   
#> 2 genome_map2 Primary Paw Paw Map Physical Map cM
```

Both maps on this test server declare a “Physical Map” type with a “cM”
unit. That’s inconsistent fixture data on this particular server, not
something brapiR2 or the BrAPI specification produces. On a real server
the two fields agree.

``` r

brapi_get_marker_map(con, mapDbId = maps$mapDbId[1])
#> # A tibble: 3 × 8
#>   variantDbId variantName mapDbId  mapName type  unit  linkageGroupName position
#>   <chr>       <chr>       <chr>    <chr>   <chr> <chr> <chr>               <int>

#> 3 variant03   M3          genome_… Primar… Phys… cM    Chromosome 1        60000
```

``` r

```

## Authentication

Most production BrAPI servers require authentication. These calls need
your own server and credentials, so they are shown but not run here.

``` r

# Username/password login - used by Breedbase, BMS, and Germinate
con <- brapi_connection("https://my-breedbase.org")
con <- brapi_login(con, "username", "password")

# OAuth 2.0 (EBS and similar)
con <- brapi_login_oauth2(
  con,
  client_id     = "my_id",
  client_secret = "my_secret",
  authorize_url = "https://auth.example.org/authorize",
  access_url    = "https://auth.example.org/token"
)

# Bearer token (GIGWA, custom servers)
con <- brapi_set_token(con, Sys.getenv("BRAPI_TOKEN"))
```

### Handling Credentials Safely

The example above reads a token from an environment variable rather than
writing it as a literal string, and that’s deliberate: a password or
token typed directly into a script gets committed to version control the
moment someone runs `git add`, and stays in the project’s history even
after it’s “removed” in a later commit. There are two safer places to
keep it.

**`.Renviron` and
[`Sys.getenv()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Sys.getenv.html).** For scripts
you run yourself, put credentials in a `.Renviron` file (in your home
directory for all projects, or in the project directory for that project
only) as `NAME=value` pairs, one per line:

    BRAPI_TOKEN=abc123...
    BRAPI_PASSWORD=my_password

R reads `.Renviron` automatically at startup, so after restarting your R
session the values are available via
[`Sys.getenv()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Sys.getenv.html):

``` r

con <- brapi_connection("https://my-breedbase.org")
con <- brapi_login(
  con, Sys.getenv("BRAPI_USERNAME"), Sys.getenv("BRAPI_PASSWORD")
)
```

Add `.Renviron` to `.gitignore` so it never gets committed.
[`usethis::edit_r_environ()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/edit.html)
opens the right file for you.

**The keyring package.** For credentials you want stored in your
operating system’s own credential manager (Keychain on macOS, Credential
Manager on Windows, Secret Service on Linux) rather than in a plaintext
file, use [keyring](https://cran.r-project.org/package=keyring).
`key_set()` prompts interactively for a secret and stores it;
`key_get()` retrieves it later, in this session or a future one, without
the value ever appearing in your script or your R history:

``` r

# Run once, interactively - prompts for the password and stores it
keyring::key_set("brapiR2_my-breedbase", username = "my_username")

# In scripts, from then on:
con <- brapi_connection("https://my-breedbase.org")
con <- brapi_login(
  con,
  username = "my_username",
  password = keyring::key_get("brapiR2_my-breedbase", username = "my_username")
)
```

Either approach keeps the secret out of the script itself, out of shell
history, and out of anything you might `git commit` or share.

**The token lives in the connection object.** Once you have
authenticated, the credential is held inside `con` and goes wherever
`con` goes: `saveRDS(con, "con.rds")` writes it to disk in plain text,
and `str(con)` or `unclass(con)` prints it in full. `print(con)` shows
only whether the connection is authenticated, never the token itself, so
that is what to paste when sharing a session or reporting a problem.

## Caching and Parallel Fetching

Two features for when you are fetching the same data repeatedly, or a
lot of it at once. Both run against the public test server here; neither
needs authentication.

**Caching** stores each response on disk under a key built from the URL
and query parameters, and returns it without a network call for as long
as the TTL lasts. Reach for it when you are developing a script against
a slow or distant server and re-running the same calls, or when a
knitted report would otherwise hit the server once per render. It is off
by default, per connection, and never shared between connections.

``` r

# Enable caching — repeated calls within the TTL return instantly
cache_dir <- tempfile("brapi_cache_")
dir.create(cache_dir)
perf_con <- brapi_cache_enable(con, ttl = 3600, dir = cache_dir)
#> ✔ Caching enabled at /tmp/RtmpSLnxSP/brapi_cache_be34c6e2514 (TTL: 3600s)

# First call: hits the server
invisible(brapi_programs(perf_con))

# Second call: reads from disk (sub-millisecond)
brapi_programs(perf_con)
#> ℹ Using cached response for /programs.
#> # A tibble: 3 × 12
#>   additionalInfo externalReferences abbreviation commonCropName documentationURL
#>   <list>         <list>             <chr>        <chr>          <chr>           
#> 1 <named list>   <list [1]>         P1           Tomatillo      https://brapi.o…
#> 2 <named list>   <list [1]>         P2           Tomatillo      https://brapi.o…
#> 3 <named list>   <list [1]>         P3           Paw Paw        https://brapi.o…
#> # ℹ 7 more variables: leadPersonDbId <chr>, leadPersonName <chr>,
#> #   objective <chr>, programName <chr>, programType <chr>,
#> #   fundingInformation <chr>, programDbId <chr>

# Clear all cached files
brapi_cache_clear(perf_con)
#> ✔ Cleared 1 cached response(s).
```

**Parallel fetching** runs one call across many identifiers at once,
which helps when you are pulling data for dozens of studies or germplasm
and each request is slow.
[`brapi_fetch_parallel()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_fetch_parallel.md)
uses whatever `future` plan is already active — sequential unless you
say otherwise — so choosing the backend, and shutting it down
afterwards, is yours to do. See [`future`’s own
documentation](https://future.futureverse.org/) for the available
backends, and DESIGN.md for why the package does not set one for you:

``` r

future::plan(future::multisession, workers = 2)

# Fetch study data from multiple studies in parallel (all studies on the
# server, not just the one attached to the trial filtered above)
study_ids <- brapi_studies(con)$studyDbId
all_data <- brapi_fetch_parallel(perf_con, brapi_study_data, study_ids)
#> ℹ Fetching 3 items...
#> ℹ Using cached response for /observations.
#> ! No observations found for study "study2".
#> ℹ Using cached response for /observations.
#> ! No observations found for study "study3".
#> ✔ Fetched 2 rows from 3 sources.
all_data
#> # A tibble: 2 × 6
#>   observationUnitDbId observationUnitName germplasmDbId germplasmName  studyDbId
#>   <chr>               <chr>               <chr>         <chr>          <chr>    
#> 1 observation_unit1   Plot 1              germplasm1    Tomatillo Fan… study1   
#> 2 observation_unit2   Plot 2              germplasm2    Tomatillo Fan… study1   
#> # ℹ 1 more variable: `Corn Stalk Height` <list>
```

As above, this server’s studies have no observations, so `all_data` is
an empty tibble here too — the call itself, and the parallel-fetch
mechanics, are real.

Since you set the plan, shutting the workers back down when you’re done
with them is your responsibility too, not something the package does for
you on exit:

``` r

future::plan(future::sequential)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Comparison with QBMS

[QBMS](https://cran.r-project.org/package=QBMS) is a well-established R
package for BrAPI access that has been widely adopted in the breeding
community. brapiR2 and QBMS are **complementary tools designed for
different workflows**.

| Feature | QBMS | brapiR2 |
|----|----|----|
| Style | Stateful (set program → set trial → set study) | Stateless (pass `con` everywhere) |
| Returns | Data frames | Tibbles (tidy, list-columns for nested data) |
| Pipe-friendly | Partial | Yes, all functions follow `f(con, ...)` |
| Caching | No | Yes, disk-based with TTL |
| Parallel fetch | No | Via the caller’s own `future` backend |
| Genotyping | Limited | Allele matrix, dosage matrix, marker map (32/37 BrAPI entities covered overall, read-only) |
| Authentication | Yes | Yes |

brapiR2 targets BrAPI v2 only, by design - see the “Design History”
section of
[DESIGN.md](https://github.com/ropensci/brapiR2/blob/main/DESIGN.md) for
why. QBMS’s own BrAPI version support is a separate question from this
comparison; check QBMS’s own documentation for its current v1/v2
coverage rather than relying on a claim made here.

### Same workflow, different style

The examples below use a private Breedbase-style server and credentials,
so they are illustrative only.

**QBMS** — navigational, stateful:

``` r

library(QBMS)

set_crop("Wheat")
login_bms("https://my-bms.org", "user", "pass")

list_programs()
set_program("Wheat Breeding")

list_trials()
set_trial("Yield Trial 2022")

list_studies()
set_study("Ithaca 2022")

data <- get_study_data()
```

**brapiR2** — functional, pipe-friendly:

``` r

library(brapiR2)
library(dplyr)

con <- brapi_connection("https://my-bms.org") |>
  brapi_login("user", "pass")

data <- brapi_programs(con) |>
  filter(programName == "Wheat Breeding") |>
  pull(programDbId) |>
  (\(pid) brapi_trials(con, programDbId = pid))() |>
  filter(trialName == "Yield Trial 2022") |>
