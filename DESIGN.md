# Design History and Architecture

This note documents why `brapiR2` has its current structure. It is
written for rOpenSci review and future maintenance.

## Design History

`brapiR2` was built to fill a gap in the R ecosystem for the Breeding
API (BrAPI) v2 specification. The existing R client, `QBMS`, is stateful
and menu-driven: it holds a “current” program, trial, or study
internally and walks the user through an interactive selection flow.
That design fits exploratory, console-driven use, but it does not fit
scripted pipelines, parallel batch jobs, or reproducible analysis code,
where the caller wants to pass an explicit connection and get a tibble
back nothing hidden, nothing stateful.

`brapiR2` was developed with Claude Code assistance. The author directed
the architecture, the public API design, and the domain logic (which
BrAPI modules to cover, how pagination and async search should behave,
how genotype calls should be encoded as dosages); the assistant
implemented those decisions and iterated against the live public BrAPI
test server (`https://test-server.brapi.org`) to validate real
request/response shapes rather than only against synthetic fixtures. The
git history for this repository is comparatively compressed relative to
the amount of surface area covered, which reflects that AI-assisted
development pattern: whole modules were scaffolded and corrected against
live server output in single passes rather than built up
commit-by-commit over weeks.

Before rOpenSci submission, the package went through a review-driven
cleanup pass: every exported function gained a runnable example
(verified against the live test server), `\dontrun{}` was replaced
package-wide with `\donttest{}` since the examples are not broken, only
network-dependent, goodpractice/lintr issues were fixed (function
length, line length, duplicated parameter docs via `@inheritParams`,
assignment style), and test coverage was raised from roughly 65% to 98%
by adding mocked unit tests alongside the existing live-server
integration tests.

## Architecture Overview

`brapiR2` is organised in layers, from the caller’s perspective inward:

1.  **Connection and auth** - build and hold connection state explicitly
    ([`brapi_connection()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_connection.md),
    [`brapi_login()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_login.md),
    [`brapi_login_oauth2()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_login_oauth2.md),
    [`brapi_set_token()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_set_token.md)).
    Nothing is stored globally.
2.  **Request engine** - a small set of internal functions that every
    exported endpoint function is built on top of. This layer owns HTTP
    request construction, transparent pagination, the BrAPI async-search
    poll protocol, and response-to-tibble parsing.
3.  **Four BrAPI modules** - Core, Germplasm, Phenotyping, and
    Genotyping. Each module is a thin, one-function-per-endpoint wrapper
    around the request engine, matching the four modules defined by the
    BrAPI v2 specification itself.
4.  **Convenience functions** - a small number of higher-level functions
    ([`brapi_study_data()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_study_data.md),
    [`brapi_get_dosage_matrix()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_get_dosage_matrix.md),
    [`brapi_get_marker_map()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_get_marker_map.md))
    that compose module functions into analysis-ready shapes (a wide
    phenotyping tibble, a numeric dosage matrix) without introducing any
    new HTTP behaviour of their own.
5.  **Caching and parallel fetching** - an optional, opt-in disk cache
    ([`brapi_cache_enable()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_cache_enable.md),
    [`brapi_cache_clear()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_cache_clear.md))
    and a parallel batch fetch helper
    ([`brapi_fetch_parallel()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_fetch_parallel.md))
    layered on top of the request engine, both off by default.

## Main Design Decisions

### Stateless connection objects, not global state

`QBMS` and similar BrAPI clients keep a mutable “current server” in
package state. `brapiR2` instead passes an explicit `brapi_con` object
as the first argument to every function, the way `httr2`, `DBI`, and
most tidyverse-style clients do. This makes it safe to hold multiple
connections (e.g. two breeding programs, or a cached and an uncached
connection to the same server) in the same session, and it makes
functions easy to test in isolation and safe to run in parallel workers.

### Tibbles everywhere, not raw lists

Every exported function that returns data returns a tibble, never a raw
parsed JSON list. BrAPI responses are deeply nested and inconsistently
shaped across servers; `parse_brapi_result()` centralizes the
list-of-records-to-tibble conversion (including the list-column fallback
for genuinely nested fields) so callers can pipe directly into `dplyr`/
`tidyr` without ever touching `$result$data` themselves.

### One function per BrAPI endpoint

Rather than one generic `brapi_call(entity, ...)` dispatcher, each BrAPI
endpoint gets its own named function
([`brapi_programs()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_programs.md),
[`brapi_trials()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_trials.md),
[`brapi_germplasm()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_germplasm.md),
…). This costs more exported functions, but each one is individually
documented, individually testable, and discoverable via autocomplete
which matters more for a spec with dozens of endpoints than a small
parameter saving would.

### Transparent pagination

BrAPI list endpoints are always paginated server-side.
[`brapi_get()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_get.md)
/ `brapi_get_pages()` walk every page automatically and return the fully
concatenated result, so callers never have to reason about `page` or
`pageSize` unless they want to override the default page size.

### Async search handled internally

BrAPI’s `/search/*` endpoints can respond either immediately (200, with
data) or asynchronously (202, with a `searchResultsDbId` to poll). Both
paths are collapsed into a single synchronous return value by
[`brapi_post_search()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_post_search.md)
/ `brapi_poll_search()`, so
[`brapi_search_germplasm()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_search_germplasm.md)
and friends behave identically to the immediate-result endpoints from
the caller’s point of view.

### `httr2`, not `httr`

`httr2` is the actively developed successor to `httr`, with a pipeable
request-builder API, built-in retry/backoff, and clearer error objects.
All of `brapiR2`’s request-engine internals (mockable in tests via
`local_mocked_bindings()`) are built on `httr2`.

### Genotyping module as the key differentiator

Core, Germplasm, and Phenotyping coverage exist in other BrAPI clients.
Handling the allele matrix’s non-standard 2D pagination, and converting
it via
[`brapi_get_dosage_matrix()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_get_dosage_matrix.md)
/
[`brapi_get_marker_map()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_get_marker_map.md)
into genomic-selection-ready numeric matrices, does not - and is the
main reason `brapiR2` exists as a separate package rather than a QBMS
contribution. This is a depth claim about the genotyping data path
specifically, not a claim that `brapiR2` covers the Genotyping module
(or any module) exhaustively; see the coverage figures in
[Boundaries](#boundaries).

### Disk-based caching keyed with `rlang::hash()`

Caching is opt-in
([`brapi_cache_enable()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_cache_enable.md)),
not automatic, so default behaviour always reflects the live server.
When enabled, each cache entry is keyed by a hash of the fully-qualified
URL plus sorted, page-excluded query parameters, so identical requests
(including identical filter arguments in a different order) reliably hit
the cache and different requests never collide.

### The caller owns the `future` plan

[`brapi_fetch_parallel()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_fetch_parallel.md)
runs against whatever `future` plan is already active and never sets one
itself. The future package’s best-practices guidance is explicit that
the choice of backend belongs to the caller, not to a package: a
function that quietly sets and restores a plan on every call still
mutates session-wide state the caller did not ask it to touch, and can
silently replace a plan configured deliberately - a specific worker
count, a cluster spanning several machines, `callr` workers for extra
isolation. The `.workers` argument in 0.1.0 did exactly this, and is
deprecated; supplying it now warns and has no effect.

### Mocked tests alongside integration tests

The test suite pairs two layers: `tests/testthat/test-*-mocked.R` files
patch `httr2`’s `req_perform()`/`resp_body_json()`/`resp_status()` (and
`future`/`furrr` for parallel fetching) via `local_mocked_bindings()` so
every code path — including pagination edge cases, async-search polling,
and cache hit/miss/expiry - runs deterministically without the live
server; `test-integration.R` and `test-cache-integration.R` separately
exercise the real test server and are skipped on CRAN and when offline.
Together they bring line coverage to about 98%.

## Boundaries

The current design deliberately leaves several things out of scope:

- **Read-only.** `brapiR2` retrieves BrAPI data; it does not implement
  the BrAPI `POST`/`PUT` endpoints for writing germplasm, observations,
  or other records back to a server. Of the BrAPI v2.1 specification’s
  201 endpoints (114 `GET`, 57 `POST` - 24 of them search, 30 `PUT`),
  the 63 write and update endpoints are out of scope by design, not an
  oversight.
- **Read coverage is intentionally partial, not exhaustive.** `brapiR2`
  wraps 32 of the specification’s 37 top-level entities across all four
  modules, covering 49 of the 138 retrieval (`GET` + search `POST`)
  endpoints - 49 of 122 endpoints within the entities it does cover.
  Common Crop Names, Germplasm Attribute Values, Planned Crosses,
  Plates, and Vendor Samples (lab/vendor order-tracking) currently have
  no coverage at all. New entities are added as real analysis needs
  surface, not to chase 100%.
- **No analysis.** Dosage matrices and wide phenotyping tibbles are
  produced in shapes that downstream genomic-selection and analysis
  packages expect, but `brapiR2` does not itself fit models, compute
  BLUPs, or perform GWAS.
- **No server-specific workarounds.** `brapiR2` targets the BrAPI v2
  specification as written. It does not carry bespoke branches for
  particular server implementations (BMS, Breedbase, EBS, GIGWA,
  Germinate); servers that deviate from spec are expected to be fixed
  upstream rather than special-cased here.
- **No visualisation.** Plotting genotype, pedigree, or phenotype data
  is left to downstream packages that consume `brapiR2`’s tibbles.

## Relationship to Other Tools

### Other BrAPI R clients

[QBMS](https://cran.r-project.org/package=QBMS),
[brapir-v2](https://github.com/mverouden/brapir-v2) (see [Design
History](#design-history)), and
[BrAPI.R](https://github.com/TriticeaeToolbox/BrAPI.R) (David Waring,
Cornell) all target the same specification from different angles.
BrAPI.R in particular is complementary rather than competing: its own
DESCRIPTION calls it “simple wrapper functions for httr that make it
easier to make manual HTTP calls to a BrAPI server”, and its README
states plainly that it “does not have any knowledge of the currently
supported BrAPI endpoints.” It is a transport layer - callers pass an
endpoint path as a string and get back a raw nested list; it supports
`GET`, `POST`, and `PUT` (with a `version` argument covering both BrAPI
v1 and v2), plus a two-step search helper and Breedbase-specific
functions explicitly outside the BrAPI spec. `brapiR2` takes the
opposite position on the same trade-off: named, individually documented
functions per endpoint that always return tibbles, at the cost of
needing an explicit function for each entity. The two are usable
together rather than as alternatives - and BrAPI.R’s `POST`/`PUT`
support covers exactly the write operations `brapiR2` deliberately
leaves out (see [Boundaries](#boundaries)).

### Downstream analysis tools

`brapiR2` sits at the start of a breeding-data analysis pipeline, not in
place of the tools downstream of it. Its job ends at a tidy tibble or
matrix retrieved from a BrAPI server; cleaning, visualisation and
modelling belong to packages built for those tasks. The genomic
selection and multi-environment articles show that boundary in practice,
handing brapiR2’s output to rrBLUP, BGLR, sommer, metan and lme4.

## Maintenance Considerations

The most likely sources of future maintenance work, roughly in order of
likelihood:

- **BrAPI specification updates.** BrAPI v2 is still evolving; new
  optional fields, endpoints, or search parameters should mostly be
  additive and land as new module functions or new `...` pass-through
  arguments, not breaking changes to existing signatures.
- **Server response drift.** Real BrAPI servers do not always implement
  the spec identically (see
  [`brapi_study_data()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_study_data.md)’s
  client-side filter fallback, and
  [`brapi_get_marker_map()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/brapiR2/reference/brapi_get_marker_map.md)’s
  `variantName`/`variantNames` handling). New drift should be handled
  the same way: defensively, in the module or convenience function
  affected, without changing the request engine.
- **`httr2` changes.** The request engine (`R/request.R`) is the sole
  integration point with `httr2`; API changes there should only ever
  require edits in that one file.
- **Test server availability.** `\donttest{}` examples and the
  integration test suite depend on `https://test-server.brapi.org`
  staying reachable and populated with its current dummy dataset
  (`program1`, `study1`, `variantset1`, and similar fixture IDs
  referenced throughout the examples and tests). If that server’s
  dataset changes shape, the mocked test suite still protects the
  request-engine logic, but examples and integration tests would need
  their hardcoded IDs updated.
